[#target]
[h5 ["Target]]

If a table object [~to] represents an SQL table at some site, and an actual SQL table [~st] exists at that site, then [~st] is called the /target/ of [~to].

That is to say, [~st] is the target of [~to] when [~st] agrees with [~to] on the following points:

* SQL table name,
* database,
* schema (PostgreSQL only), and
* attached database (sqlite only).

[#conforms_to]
[h5 ["Conforms to]]

An SQL table [~st] is said to /conform to/ a table object [~to] when:

* [~st] is [~to]'s target,
* [~st] has all the column names that [~to]'s value mapper uses,
* those columns have the types that [~to]'s value mapper expects,
* those columns' =NOT NULL= constraints have the settings that [~to]'s value mapper expects, and
* [~st] does not have any other columns.
